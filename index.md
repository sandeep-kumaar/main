Hello! My name is Sandeep Kumar and I am currently an enginner at Qualcomm. My focus has been on the design and enhancement of Wired Peripherals Digital IPs. Major contributions include the development of new low-power cores, the invention of unique techniques to enhance their performance, and the resolution of software/customer (OEM) concerns in pre and post-silicon. Throughout this process, I have discovered a passion for research coupled with a strong motivation for collaboration, invention, and execution. As an incoming Ph.D. student, I am motivated to build on this approach and delve deeply into the field of circuit design, with an emphasis on Analog/RFIC design and Energy-efficient Hardware architecture.  Please find my [CV] (https://sandeep-kumaar.github.io/main/cv/) and [Personal Statement] (https://sandeep-kumaar.github.io/main/ps/).
